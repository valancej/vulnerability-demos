# Identifying vulnerabilities with Anchore

## Introduction

By far one the most common challenges Anchore helps it's users solve is the identification of vulnerabities within their Docker container images. Anchore analysis tools will inspect container images and generate a detailed manifest of the image, a virtual 'bill of materials' that includes official operating system packages, unofficial packages, configuration files, and language modules and artifacts. Following this Anchore will evaluate policies against the analysis result, which includes vulnerability matches on the artifacts discovered in the image.

Quite often, Docker images contain both application and operating system packages. However, in this particular post, I will focus on the identification of a specific vulnerable package inside an image, walkthrough how it can be visualized within the Anchore Enteprise UI, and what might an approach be to remediate this vulnerable package.

Since I will be discussing Anchore Enterprise, the vulnerablity data feed I will be leveraging is Snyk. I recently wrote a post discussing the choice at Anchore to add this high quality vulnerability data source to our enterprise platform which you can read about [here](https://anchore.com/blog/improving-open-source-security-with-anchore-snyk/).
